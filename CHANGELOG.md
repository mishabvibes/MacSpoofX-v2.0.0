## Migration Guide

### From v1.0.0 to v2.0.0

#### Command Changes

**v1.0.0**:
```bash
sudo python macspoofx_old.py
```

**v2.0.0**:
```bash
sudo python3 macspoofx.py --mode random
```

#### New Requirements

- Python 3.7+ (was Python 2.7/3.x)
- Additional packages: prettytable, schedule, netifaces, colorama
- Kali Linux recommended (was any Linux)

#### Configuration Changes

- No configuration file in v1.0.0
- v2.0.0 uses command-line arguments exclusively
- Logging now automatic to macspoofx.log

#### Breaking Changes

- `-r` flag removed (use `--mode random`)
- `-c` now requires `--mode custom` and `--custom-mac`
- Output format changed (now supports JSON/CSV)

#### Migration Steps

1. Backup existing scripts using v1.0.0
2. Install v2.0.0 using install.sh
3. Update command syntax to new format
4. Test in isolated environment
5. Update automation scripts
